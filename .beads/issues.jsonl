{"id":"MarkdownToPDF-aw7","title":"Design: Technical planning for PDF manipulation features","description":"Create detailed technical design for both new features:\n\nSHARED REQUIREMENTS:\n- Refactor convert_to_pdf.py into a CLI tool with argparse\n- Add new dependencies: pypdf (or PyPDF2) for PDF manipulation\n- Consider reportlab or pdfplumber for text extraction\n\nFEATURE 1 - APPEND (Simpler):\n- Input: existing_pdf_path, markdown_file_path, output_path\n- Steps: 1) Convert markdown to temp PDF, 2) Open existing PDF, 3) Append pages, 4) Save\n- Complexity: Medium\n\nFEATURE 2 - REPLACE BY HEADER (Complex):\n- Input: existing_pdf_path, markdown_file_path, output_path, --replace-mode flag\n- Steps: 1) Extract text from each PDF page, 2) Parse markdown sections by ## headers, 3) Match titles, 4) Generate new pages for matches, 5) Reconstruct PDF with replaced pages\n- Challenges: Text extraction accuracy, header matching logic, page size/formatting consistency\n- Complexity: High\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n- Architecture decision: which PDF libraries to use\n- CLI interface design\n- Implementation order (suggest: append first, then replace)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tendimensions@gmail.com","estimated_minutes":60,"created_at":"2026-02-12T08:59:09.371201412-05:00","created_by":"Jason Poggioli","updated_at":"2026-02-12T08:59:09.371201412-05:00","labels":["design","planning"]}
{"id":"MarkdownToPDF-c3f","title":"Feature: Replace PDF slides by matching headers","description":"Add functionality to replace specific slides in a PDF when markdown headers match slide titles.
